SVG is a small object-oriented Javascript library, developed to facilitate the creation of SVG.
The way it was developed allows easy understanding of the most commonly used integrated development environments (IDE), with autocomplete and documentation of methods and parameters.

It also has an independent class for exporting SVG in other formats, such as canvas or image.

There is not yet an external documentation to explain in detail how to use it, but a quick look at the coding of the examples provided, allows the library to be used easily.
